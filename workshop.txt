title=No More Skilless Characters
description=Are you tired of being months into your world and starting new characters that have "survived" all this time, only to have no skills? Me too!
description=
description=This mod allows your new character to have randomized skill sets at spawn. It's very customizeable and allows you to progressively expand how many skills your new character gets over time and even how skilled they are!
description=
description=This is only my second mod, so please do let me know if you run into any issues or bugs!
description=
description=(PREVIOUSLY NO MORE SKILLESS SURVIVORS): Apologies to everyone that may have been mislead. I'm fairly new to PZ and even newer to PZ modding! I wasn't aware the word 'Survivor' was strongly associated with NPC's. This mod is for YOUR player character, not ai controlled characters.
description=
description=CURRENTLY UNTESTED IN MP. If you try it out and there are issues, please do let me know and I'll try to iron them out when possible.

description=COMPATIBILITY
description=-Users of Ryuu's Superior Survivors - Update 17.3, may want to place NMSS under SS in load order to prevent any potential conflicts (will investigate further to see if it will actually be an issue)
description=
description=FUTURE PLANS:
description=-Add option to keep skills received from professions when using 'Blank slate'
description=-Add ability to delay the Progressive options from starting until after a certain amount of time has passed

description=BIG shoutout to some of the people over in the discord (notably @Konijima and @VMK) for the help and direction when I needed it! You guys are great!
